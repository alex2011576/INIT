# Init

A project where I have learnt about Linux, Networks and VM VirtualBox. 

The point of this projects was to learn:
 * basic commands in MacOOS for network manipulations
 * basic commands in Linux for system and network manipulations,
 * writing simple Bash scripts for system manipulatios,
 * setting up VM Virtual Box and ssh-connections.

The work is split in 3 parts:
- network
- system
- scripts
